Hi, I'm **Mirzokhidjon Yakubov**, a highly motivated and results-oriented Chief Specialist with extensive experience in international finance, central banking, and economic policy development. Over the course of my career, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of financial systems, regulatory compliance, and economic governance, with a strong track record of representing the Central Bank of Uzbekistan in engagements with leading international financial institutions, including the IMF, World Bank, and foreign central banks.  

My professional experience encompasses monitoring and evaluating the Bank’s compliance with international agreements, overseeing the accreditation and regulatory approval of foreign bank representative offices, and coordinating complex projects across multiple government agencies. I have been responsible for preparing detailed analytical reports, providing strategic policy recommendations, and supporting high-level decision-making processes that strengthen financial operations and ensure alignment with global standards.  

Beyond technical expertise, I am passionate about leadership and capacity building. I have led cross-functional teams, mentored junior economists, and implemented initiatives that enhance operational efficiency, transparency, and organizational performance. My work is driven by a commitment to fostering collaboration, promoting best practices, and achieving measurable outcomes that support the sustainable growth of Uzbekistan’s financial sector.  

In addition to my central banking experience, I have also held leadership roles in the private sector, managing financial operations, budgeting, strategic planning, and personnel management. These experiences have enhanced my ability to navigate complex financial environments, make informed strategic decisions, and lead teams toward achieving organizational goals.  

I am committed to continuous learning and professional development, staying informed on global economic trends, financial regulations, and emerging best practices. By combining technical expertise, leadership skills, and international experience, I aim to contribute meaningfully to financial governance, policy development, and organizational growth both in public institutions and the broader financial sector.
